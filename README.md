# "What's in that cocktail?" Game

This is a personal project to practice front-end development and using APIs. The game will allow users to guess what ingredients are in a cocktail based on recipes found on [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), which provides an open API for various cocktail recipes.

## Current Plan

*Back-end*

1) Retrieve all cocktail IDs available on CocktailDB <- CURRENTLY HERE
2) Get full ingredients list
3) Label each ingredients as **alcohol** or **other** (in Excel?)
4) Save above file as JSON to utilize in front-end

*Front-end*

1) Create HTML file to create a general layout
2) Work on mobile-responsiveness
3) Add necessary event listeners based on one drinks object
4) Work on randomly choosing cocktails
4) Work on CSS
