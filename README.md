# "What's in that cocktail?" Game

This is a personal project to practice front-end development and using APIs. The quiz will allow users to guess what ingredients are in a cocktail based on recipes found on [CocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), which provides an open API for various cocktail recipes. I used [sitepoint's article](https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/) on creating JavaScript quizzes as a starting point for front-end development.

## Current Plan

*Back-end*

1) Retrieve all cocktail IDs available on CocktailDB <- IN PROGRESS
2) Get full ingredients list
3) Label each ingredients as **alcohol** or **other** (in Excel?)
4) Save above file as JSON to utilize in front-end
5) Create code to get random id and generate elements required in generating front-end quiz

*Front-end*

1) Create HTML file to set a general layout <- ROUGH DRAFT COMPLETE
2) Work on mobile-responsiveness <- IN PROGRESS
3) Create JavaScript to control quiz <- IN PROGRESS
4) Connect to back-end
5) Work on CSS
